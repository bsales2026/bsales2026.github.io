    Hi! I am a student, a brother, and a son who is lazy, Just to be frank. I made this website for my project, as well as sharing my hobbies that may become of interest to others. Although it is rushed, I do hope that it still manages to qualify, or be something where someone picks up a new interest from, if I do upload it online. Since I was hasty in creating this, I apologize for lacking some content, and hope in the future, I can create a better website with better time management, so that I can properly entertain my guests. Thank you!
